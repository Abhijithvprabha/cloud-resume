This project is a personal portfolio hosted on AWS, designed to showcase cloud infrastructure skills. The cloud resume includes basic details about my experience and expertise, and is deployed using Amazon S3 for static website hosting. The project uses GitHub for version control and leverages GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), ensuring that the resume is automatically updated with any changes made to the code.

The Cloud Resume Project is a great way to demonstrate proficiency with cloud technologies, including AWS services, automation with CI/CD pipelines, and version control with GitHub. The resume itself is designed to be simple and clear, with a focus on the cloud skills that Iâ€™ve developed through various projects and certifications.
